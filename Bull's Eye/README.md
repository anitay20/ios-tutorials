**Bull's Eye**

I got this tutorial from the iOS Apprentice 1 - getting started guide from the raywenderlich.com website.

It's a game to use the slider to get as close to the target value.

Todo:
* Get assets - bull's eye, reset button
* Create elements for screen - 
* Add autolayout to each element
* Hit Me button - needs to calculate difference between target and slider value
* Add System pop up, different messages for spot on or difference
* Add reset button - resets score, rounds, slider value, new random number

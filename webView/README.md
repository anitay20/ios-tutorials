**webView** is an app that displays a webpage.

There are different ways to implement a UI Webview into your app.

* This currently uses Rob Percival's method from the udemy course, constructing an NSURL, using a browser to download the content and then displaying it in an UIWebView element.
* Another option is to use WKWebview with this tutorial: http://www.alphansotech.com/blogs/how-to-use-web-view-in-ios-using-swift/
* There's also a tutorial on loading different kind of webpages here: http://sourcefreeze.com/uiwebview-example-using-swift-in-ios/
